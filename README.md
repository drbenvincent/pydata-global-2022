# pydata-global-2022
Notebooks supporting my PyData Global 2022 talk, [What-if? Causal reasoning meets Bayesian Inference](https://global2022.pydata.org/cfp/talk/FQBSP8/).

Find out more about the `CausalPy` repo at [pymc-labs/CausalPy](https://github.com/pymc-labs/CausalPy).

Link to the talk on YouTube will be added when it's available.

## Environment setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate whatif
python -m ipykernel install --user --name whatif
```

You should then be set up and able to run the notebooks.
